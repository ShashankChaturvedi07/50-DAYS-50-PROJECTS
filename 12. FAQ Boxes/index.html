                Where did I come from ?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                We're fascinated by origin stories—Batman, P.T. Barnum, Han Solo. Where did they come from? I think we need to go back even farther though. Does the story of life go back to a primordial soup? My answer to this question has major ramifications on my life. If the answer is “yes,” then my allegiance should primarily be to myself, to my survival and advancement. If, on the other hand, my answer is that we come from a Maker, then it's worthwhile to ask questions like the ones that follow.

                Identity - Who am I ?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                It’s been well documented that millennials struggle with questions of individual meaning and identity, so this question seems particularly relevant for that generation. But the question of identity is one we all deal with.

                I've written about it elsewhere using terms                 like voice, center, path, and toolbox. What do              you believe differentiates you and us and               humanity? It ties naturally to the next             question, which is one of meaning.

                Why am I here?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                Increasingly, we demand purpose at work, but ironically, we often fail to ask the question of life as a whole. Perhaps it's because we're so distracted by our buzzing smartphones and list of responsibilities to seek out an answer.

But even if you say you don't know the answer, your life displays what you think the purpose of life is. Perhaps, like Ryan Harwood—the CEO of PureWow—your life says, “Happiness is the barometer.” Or maybe it says something else—to share joy and kindness with others, to leave a legacy, to win and prove yourself, to glorify God, to leave the world better than you found it.

                How should we live ?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                When asked about work-life balance, Ryan Alovis, the millennial CEO of the Stella Group said, “Having everything you want in the office and everything you want outside of the office.”

Is that the goal? Or are there more objective rules to live by? Every religion has its code of ethics, but even the non-religious live with a sense of morality. C.S. Lewis wrote, “Think of a country where people were admired for running away in battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country where two and two made five.” His point is that religious or not, we believe in concepts of right and wrong.

What is permissible? What is best? For you, if it's the morality outlined in the Bible, there are some pretty tough commands there—love your neighbor as yourself, forgive whoever has hurt you, and so on. You can't live up to it with a “I've never robbed a bank, after all.”

                Where are we going ?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                Even in a world where fewer and fewer people believe in God, people still believe in an afterlife. Even in a society where progress has led to pain and suffering in so many ways, humanity continues to push forward for progress. We innately think that we’re going somewhere, whether individually or as a culture and a species.

                In other words, what is our destiny? What happens to you after you die? What happens to humanity as it moves forward? Are we on a march of progress toward a greater and greater society or are we walking toward an end in which we destroy ourselves? What you think of the destiny of yourself and others should impact the way you live today.
